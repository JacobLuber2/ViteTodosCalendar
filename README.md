# ViteTodosCalendar

## About
- A calendar that a user can make an account and manage their daily todo items.
- I wanted to learn how full stack development works which is why I made this project.

### Features
- Handles user registration/logins and encrypts their password using bcrypt.
- A user can track and manage their todos for any given day.

### Planned Features
- Add visual feedback when a user wants to make an account with a username that has already been used.
- When a new user makes an account, redirect them to the calendar page.
- Handle user logouts.
- Improve the styling on all pages.
- Add account deletion functionality.
- Create a custom calendar page (instead of react-calendar package.)
- Handle email signups.
- Add more graceful error handling.
